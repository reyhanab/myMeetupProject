All rides require you to wear a helmet approved for bicycle riding. The START time posted is the time the group LEAVES the parking lot. Please arrive early enough so that you are ON your bike and READY TO ROLL 5 minutes before the start of the ride. Please note that member clubs expect you to be able to MAINTAIN the posted pace of the ride. If you have a 30 pound hybrid and walk your bike up hills, don't show up for a 18-20 mph pace ride and expect everyone to slow down so you can keep up. You should carry all tools and parts needed to repair your own flats.",
