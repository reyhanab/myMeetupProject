Please arrive early enough so that you are ON your bike and READY TO ROLL 5 minutes before the start of the ride. Please note that member clubs expect you to be able to MAINTAIN the posted pace of the ride. If you have a 30 pound hybrid and walk your bike up hills, don't show up for a 18-20 mph pace ride and expect everyone to slow down so you can keep up. You should carry all tools and parts needed to repair your own flats.",
